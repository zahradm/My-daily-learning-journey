## What was the problem? How to solve it?
With the hugging face library, I wanted to predict the sentiment of a sentence. So, I ran 'clf = pipeline(task='sentiment-analysis', model=model_name, tokenizer=tokenizer) to predict 'sentence.' But it didn't work (though it did work one month ago). You can solve this by clearing the tokenizer parameter in clf.
