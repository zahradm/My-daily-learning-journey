# What was the problem? How to solve it?

There are many strategies for federated learning. My goal was to detect anomalies in SWat dataset using federated learning. One of the clearest codes that I found for federated learning is [this notebook](https://github.com/janerjzou/AD_FL_DL/blob/main/Federated%20Model.ipynb). I would like to thank the author of this code for sharing this notebook!\
After my supervisor confirms my code, I will share it as well!
